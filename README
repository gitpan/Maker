Maker          bdpO  Yet Another Make Replacement                 JPRIT


A make-like program that is written completely in perl.  It sports
powerful rules, minimal inferencing, and an object-oriented design.
Written out of long disgust with the usual make programs, it is
hopefully a solid improvement and worth the learning curve.
